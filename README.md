**Dataset: Wholesale price for agricultural commodities ([WPI](https://eaindustry.nic.in/)).**

*Time series predictions for small data set.*

**Abstract**
Predictions based on Sequential Data such as timeseries
data of agricultural product prices play a crucial role in
agriculture-based business. Determination of inflation in prices
help farmers and associated businesses to take corrective measures
for higher returns. However, unavailability of enough collective
and accurate data for Indian Markets challenges accuracy.
This paper captures the advantage of NN (Neural Networks) and
FZ (Fuzzy Systems) for predictions based on time series analysis
with limited data. NN learn by adjusting the weights between
connecting neurons. This helps in pattern recognition of similar
data points. Recent developments in DL (Deep Learning) such
as the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) variant, LSTM (Long
Short Term Memory) dominates the trade market predictions.
LSTM solves the gradient descent problem of traditional NN and
remembers temporal patterns. FZ, on the other hand, helps in
making inference about human cognition through membership
functions. Learning capabilities of NN and Fuzzy rules form the
novel Neuro-Fuzzy system termed as FLSTM (Fuzzy-LSTM).
Further, the data set contains monthly wholesale prices published
by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Govt. of India for
essential agricultural commodities. The evaluation based on the
proposed work shows decent improvement than some standard
DL model for various entities when subject to limited records.
